The website front end is done with Vanilla Javascript development without the use of modern front-end frameworks like React. The decision to not utilize React, Angular, or Vue was made to deepen my understanding of the inner workings and fundamentals of web development. The back-end server is set up using nodejs and express that connects to a mongoDB for storage. The mongoDB is deployed with Mongo Atlas and the rest with Render. My github contains a public repo with the project code",
